Need to Fix
- Form Validation for Registration
- UI Look
- In app.jsx, see if moving the useEffect for checkign for a jwt token
would work inside the useEffect that updates the weather.


On page load, you check for a token with getToken()
If there isn't one just return i.e. continue
You make a request to your server via the api file,
The server should be returning the name email and avatar of that token.
console
Then set log in to true, and set the user data.


- Fix look of login, register and logout buttons on Header and modals
- I think delete button on modals might be misplaced.

Stopped at editing profile logic.
Next thing to do is liking api.

Inside ItemCard, there is handleLike.
- handleLike is a callback function, which executes props.handleLike(), which comes from main.
- In main, you pass the item card's id, and is liked.
- Main's handleCardLike is received through props, fom App.jsx.
- In app.jsx there is the final handleCardike, which communicates with the API.
- You need to connect the api to the server, you should probably start by figuring out what is 
being sent or received from the server, and how all this works.
